# Investment Dashboard

A simple web-based portfolio tracker. Open `index.html` in your browser to get started.

Data entered in the application is automatically saved to **localStorage** so it is available the next time you open the page. Sample data is loaded the first time if no saved data exists.

Use the navigation menu to manage accounts, stocks, transactions and dividends. The **Analysis** tab displays cumulative realized profit/loss and dividend income over time.
